# CCTree - Categorical Clustering Tree
This is a simple and basic python implementation of the CCTree (Categorical Clustering Tree) algorithm, proposed by Mina Sheikh Alishahi, Mohamed Mejri and Nadia Tawbi, in the paper <a href="http://www.scitepress.org/portal/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=44Nf2WZJ6Qw=&t=1">Clustering Spam Emails into Campaigns</a>.

Launch the ExampleApp.py to see how the CCTree works, in each iteration. You could also use the CCTreeDemonstrator class, to make your own demonstration. If you want to learn more about the CCTree algorithm, take a look at the <a href="http://www.scitepress.org/portal/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=44Nf2WZJ6Qw=&t=1">paper</a>.
